But using cross platform standards, and the latest innovations in ASP.NET, I will build from scratch a back-end suitable for a Mobile Backend. You could target any functionality or group of functionalities, but to spice things up, I will target Office 365 as the back-end. I will explain my architectural decisions, and aim to target HTML5, Cordova, and Native (iOS) platforms. This talk is a companion talk to Building a HTML5 mobile app using AngularJS</p>
