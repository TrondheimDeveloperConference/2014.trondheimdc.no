A key difference between Bluetooth and other wireless standards is that it even defines application uses-cases (as adapted profiles). In this session we will look at the new Bluetooth Low energy API&#8217;s in Android L and learn how to use them to implement these adopted profiles as well as other gotchas with the API.</p>
