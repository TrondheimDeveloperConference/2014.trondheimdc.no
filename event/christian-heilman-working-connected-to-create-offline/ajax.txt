That&#8217;s one of the reasons why HTML5 is not the revolution that replaces native apps. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Mozilla shows just how much developers can benefit from working online and what you can do to ensure that the users of our products have a great offline experience. &#8220;Offline first&#8221; is a great principle, and we can use the web to achieve it.</p>
