When I say SMS or short message service, we mostly think that it’s a text message. Is it only a text message? how about binary message or not for human message?. Talk shows how businesses and telecoms uses SMS as a bearer to execute remote commands on SIM cards.</p>
<h4>SENTHURAN SELVARATNAM:</h4><p>Think. Ask why. Do it. I started programming database centric applications and then moved to smartphone/feature phone world where I developed platform to manage mobile phone provisioning and SIM management via SMS.</p>
