The digital revolution has yet to fulfill its promise of higher productivity and better jobs.&#8221; That&#8217;s not me; it’s the renowned magazine Economist, Oct. 2014. After +40 years of IT development, we still see lots of IT disappointments and disasters. Why? I claim it’s about connections. It’s the clash of Moore’s law vs the law of diminishing returns. So what can save us?</p>
<h4>JONAS SöDERSTRöM:</h4><p>Jonas is the author of ”Jævla drittsystem!” (Stupid bloody system!) and a consultant with InUse Experience. A digital pioneer, who has worked with huge organizations like the Swedish Parliament and the Council of Europe for 20 years, he is now very concerned about the rise of Bureaucracy2.0. He’s also been appointed to the National Forum on Usability and Accessibility by the Swedish government.</p>
