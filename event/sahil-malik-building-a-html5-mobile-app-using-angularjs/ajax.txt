But since that talk uses cross platform standards, you don’t really have to attend both. Leveraging the service architecture I build in the previous talk, in this talk, I will build a cross platform SPA (single page application) using OAuth for authentication, built entirely using AngularJS and HTML5. While we are at it, I will also make it responsive using Bootstrap. It’s amazing what you can achieve in 30 minutes.</p>
